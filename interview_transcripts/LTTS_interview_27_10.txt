L&T interview on 27-10; 1st round; Project realted to testing 5G Qualcomm modems
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.consider the text file with following data. (frequently encountering file handling realted Qs in interviews )
	Architecture:          x86_64
	CPU op-mode(s):        32-bit, 64-bit
	Byte Order:            Little Endian
	CPU(s):                8
	On-line CPU(s) list:   0-7
	Thread(s) per core:    2
	Core(s) per socket:    4
	Socket(s):             1
	NUMA node(s):          1
	Vendor ID:             GenuineIntel
	CPU family:            6
	Model:                 94

	Requirement:
	Read the above file and tranform the data into python dictionary.

2. 
	write a function that receives a List of strings,
	the function should return a new List that contains the words that consist of the exact same letters,
	the order of the words in the returned List should be like the order of the original.
	For example:
	List = ["pool", "hey", "why", "polo", "pol", "lopo", "apolo", "hye"]
	So the function should return exactly:
	ret = ['pool', 'hey', 'polo', 'lopo', 'hye']


3.
	class A: 
    def __init__(self): 
        self.__i = 1 
        self.j = 5 
    def display(self):
        print(self.__i, self.j) 
	class B(A): 
		def __init__(self): 
			super().__init__() 
			self.__i = 2 
			self.j = 7 
	c = B() 
	c.display()
	
	What is output? (The values of self.__i, self.j)

4.What is difference between append and extend methods of lists ?

5. Expalin OSI model ?(Networking related - 7 layer model)

6. Difference between TCP and UDP protocols?

7. Are you interested to work in testing of 5G mobile protocols
